### Who do I contact in my organization, to solve my problem?

Who do I need to get in touch with to get access to a database? Who do I ask about some
issues I found with outdated documentation? Who can give me last year’s sales report? What if
none of my coworkers know the answer? The problem is figuring out who to ask for help.
In essence, having teams and individuals working in segregated “silos” within an organization
reduces organizational efficiency by failing to share knowledge and expertise across different
domains. These silos can be caused by any number of reasons, including corporate culture, lack
of unifying vision, and even just poor collaboration skills. Though a more practical reason could
be “[the inevitable difficulties in knowing who is doing what and who to engage with inside large,
geographically dispersed organizations](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/23/6860)" (de Waal et al., 2019).

Siloed working environments can affect anyone within an organization, but especially
newer members who do not have the same level of institutional knowledge as their more senior
counterparts. New members are not familiar with methods, norms, and workings of their
organization, and will struggle the most with figuring out how to break out of their silo and ask
external parties for help when needed.

Silos can be seen as “[working as part of a close-knit group of people, who trust each
other implicitly and have each other’s back, [which] would be regarded by many as a huge plus
point,](https://www-emerald-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/insight/content/doi/10.1108/HRMID-03-2019-0058/full/html)”
(HRMID, 2019). However, “[given today’s co-dependencies of many cross-functional and
agile teams with many external stakeholders (...), the emergence of a silo mentality therefore
becomes a barrier to their success.](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JWAM-07-2023-0064/full/html)”
(Jeske & Olson, 2024). And these silos affect the vast majority of organizations. In fact, in the 
American Management Association’s Survey on Internal Collaboration, it was found that “[silos, or corporate turfs, [...] exist in 83 percent of the
companies that responded to the survey. Further, 97 percent of that group said the silos had a
negative effect on their organizations,](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ert.20001)” (Stone, 2004).

In a meta-analysis of “[silo-busting](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/23/6860)” approaches performed by de Waal et al. (2019), there
are five categories of approaches to solving the problem. Each approach was evaluated based on
collaboration results, standardized regression weights for significant influence (at the p < 0.05
level) given as β. “Values”: collaboration is promoted as common organizational value (β =
0.330). “Collaborative operating model”: the organizational infrastructure is designed in a way
that facilitates collaboration (β = 0.196). “Collaborative environment”: fostering collaborative
behaviour in the organization (β = 0.089). “Leadership”: managers directly practice and promote
collaboration (β = 0.171). “People reward and development”: incentivizing collaborative
behaviour (β = 0.390). This would indicate that the most effective approaches (most positive β-
values) for breaking down communication silos are promoting collaboration as a key value and
incentivizing collaborative behaviour.
The prevalence of silos can be in part attributed to the rise of remote work in lieu of the
pandemic, as members from all over the world can more readily participate in an organization
without ever meeting each other. As hybrid and remote work continues, layoffs take place and
institutional knowledge is lost, it is critically important for organizations to have plans in place to
break down silos and foster cross-team collaboration.
