### Improving Option Planning for Management Engineering Students

Management Engineering students currently use a tool called EngAdvisor to track their progress towards degree completion. 
The tool is very basic, providing non-iterative feedback as it simply states if courses are completed or non-completed. 
The tool lacks an intuitive interface, making it difficult for students to manage their progress towards completion of different options. 
In the past, the approach to academic advising primarily relied on direct communication with advisors. While the launch of EngAdvisor 
aimed to digitize this process, its lack of interactivity caused students to rely on other resources like UW Flow which is a course review website, 
slide decks and spreadsheets to map out their degree progress. The main cause of the problem is that the intended scope and design of EngAdvisor did 
not include personalization and data visualization. Moreover, "[EngAdvisor is not maintained from a developer standpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X371Ihv5VzYx1qlp7VVZd9-UrDcDcTUW7-t9dzS5eRg/edit?usp=sharing)", making it difficult to integrate new features (G. Tang, personal communication, October 05, 2024).

The primary stakeholder affected by the current limitations are Management Engineering undergraduate students. Due to the lack of interactivity, 
students struggle to see how far along they are through their degree/option completion, leading to confusion and extra stress. Currently, students 
are resorting to other tools to self-manage their degree planning progress, leading to inconsistencies and errors. The academic advising team is 
also impacted by the limitations of the tool as students are frequently inquiring and needing clarifications, adding to their workload. 

Efforts to improve the shortcomings of EngAdvisor have been primarily focused on expanding the existing system and incorporating more features to the platform. The 2025 Capstone team, Optâ€™On, is working on expanding EngAdvisor by including a recommendation algorithm, specifically for students pursuing the Management Sciences Option. While this is a positive step towards addressing the problem, there have been significant challenges with updating EngAdvisor's outdated technology, slowing down and complicating the development of more advanced features like the recommendation algorithm. Alternatively, an unofficial platform called UWPath, serves a degree planning website for University of Waterloo students as it verifies prerequisites and degree fulfillment. However, students have noted that "[the site quickly falls apart with more sophisticated use-cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/mlfnbb/can_wusa_propose_that_uw_implement_an_automated/)" 
(ComputerBunnyMath123, 2020). Although there are ongoing efforts, there is yet a solid solution targeting option planning for Management Engineering students. 

From an environmental perspective, EngAdvisor creates more reliance on physical resources like interactions with academic advisors. From a social perspective, students may face more confusion and stress due to the lack of interactive features, limiting their ability to take control of their academic journey. The economic dimension includes loss of productivity for both students and advisors, as they spend more time inquiring and addressing concerns that could be avoided through a more data-driven platform. Additionally, the outdated technologies make it challenging to update the tool without significant investment in redevelopment. As per this analysis, there is an opportunity to implement a more visual and low-tech adaptable solution that caters to the frequently changing and diverse needs of Management Engineering students.
