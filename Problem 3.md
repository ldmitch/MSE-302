### The Global Impact of Fast Fashion 

The term “fast fashion” refers to a business model in which inexpensive clothing is manufactured in large quantities in response to current trends. This industry is currently booming, with the biggest brands being Zara, H&M, and exclusively online stores such as Shein, Temu, and Fashion Nova (McDonald & Nicioli, 2023). In 2023, the fast fashion industry was estimated to be [worth $1.7 trillion and had approximately 300 million people working on producing clothing products](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-fast-fashion). Evidently, consumers love fast fashion; it is affordable, trendy, and convenient. In fact, in 2024, according to a report published by Business of Fashion and McKinsey, [40% of consumers in the US had shopped from Shein and Temu](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-fast-fashion). This number would be much larger if other large fast fashion retailers were included (“What is fast fashion?”, 2023). 

There are many issues with fast fashion, including environmental damage, poor labour practices, and a lack of transparency. To begin, fast fashion brands require extensive water, energy, and chemicals to produce a high volume of clothing. Particularly, the fast fashion industry contributes to approximately [10% of global carbon emissions](https://davidsuzuki.org/living-green/the-environmental-cost-of-fast-fashion/). It is also the [second largest cause of water wastage](https://davidsuzuki.org/living-green/the-environmental-cost-of-fast-fashion/), behind agricultural use. Many fast fashion brands outsource their production to mass-produce cheap clothing, resulting in poor working conditions and low wages. These businesses target underprivileged people in developing countries to prioritize low costs. In fact, according to the David Suzuki Foundation, a study conducted in an Indian textile factory found that [60% of employees were under 18 when they started working](https://davidsuzuki.org/living-green/the-environmental-cost-of-fast-fashion/) (“The environmental costs of Fast Fashion,” 2023).  

To address this problem, some fast fashion brands have attempted to become more sustainable. They claim to use eco-friendly materials, sustainable practices, and green energy. However, oftentimes they deceive customers with incorrect claims to misrepresent their environmental efforts. This is called [“greenwashing,”](https://davidsuzuki.org/living-green/the-environmental-cost-of-fast-fashion/) which many popular brands such as Nike, H&M, and Zara have been culprits of. Consumers must consciously avoid falling into these tactics through research and buying from proven sustainable brands. This is difficult though due to the lack of transparency from fast fashion brands on the extent of their environmental impact. Brands proven to be sustainable are also known to be niche and too expensive (“The environmental costs of Fast Fashion,” 2023). Another alternative solution is buying used clothing from secondhand thrift stores. This, however, does not have the same appeal as fast fashion. According to a study conducted by McKinsey & Company, [66% of consumers prefer new and trendy clothing over secondhand clothing](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-fast-fashion) due to the stigma surrounding quality and style (“What is fast fashion?”, 2023). 

Overall, fast fashion is a global problem, affecting ecosystems all over the world. It has environmental impacts as a result of water wastage, chemical pollution, and waste. The social impacts include labor exploitation and the promotion of unsustainable consumption habits. Although current efforts have been made to address this problem, alternative solutions could be explored to promote sustainable fashion choices and raise awareness.
